The ar utility header file was not available within the Android NDK or the sash source.
However, its also available in the bionic source: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/libc/include/ar.h
But at the time of taking the source, we took it from OpenBSD github repo which is also in the family of UNIX systems,
as noted the header file belongs to The Regents of the University of California or Unix Laboratories Inc and hence is
